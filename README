# CrowdRise SaltStack File Base

- Keep the layout consistent.

## Hostnames

Given the following hostname
+ myclass1.myproduct.mycluster2.crowdrise.io

We get the following info available as grains
class | myclass
class_instance | 1
product | myproduct
cluster | mycluster
cluster_instance | 2
business | crowdrise
tld | io

This info is used to lay out name based path traversal for state execution.

In the above example you could create the following state files that would be executed everytime the minion executes state.highstate

- class/myclass/init.sls
- product/myproduct.sls
- class/myclass/product/myproduct/init.sls
- cluster/mycluster/cluster_instance/2/init.sls
