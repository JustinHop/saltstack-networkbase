# This state ID is going to have just a "require" instead of a "watch"
# statement because of:
#
# a) the varnish service is defined as reload=true and to actually apply changes
#    in this config file it's necessary a restart
# b) restart is potentially dangerous because it deletes the cache, so it's
#    preferrable to trigger an explicit and controlled restart after changing
#    this file
#
# As you probably know, to run a restart of the service you could use something
# like: salt 'varnish-node*' service.varnish restart.
